# SONAR Signal Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying SONAR signals to distinguish between rocks and mines. The project leverages supervised learning algorithms and follows a systematic approach involving data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can classify SONAR returns as either coming from a **rock** or a **mine**, based on a set of frequency-based features extracted from the signals.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Filename**: `sonar data.csv`
- **Instances**: 208  
- **Features**: 60 continuous frequency-based attributes  
- **Target**: `M` (Mine) or `R` (Rock)

## 🧪 Project Workflow

### 1. 📥 Data Loading
- Load the CSV dataset using Pandas.
- Display basic information and check for missing values.

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Basic statistics and class distribution.
- Pairplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
- Feature-wise distribution analysis.

### 3. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Convert labels to numeric using Label Encoding.
- Normalize/standardize features if required.
- Train-test split (commonly 80:20 or 70:30).

### 4. 🤖 Model Building
- Trained multiple classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV (if applicable).

### 5. 📈 Model Evaluation
- Metrics used:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - ROC-AUC Curve
- Compared performance across models.

### 6. 🏁 Final Model Selection
- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
- Justified the choice with visual and statistical comparisons.
